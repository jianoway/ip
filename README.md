# Code Quality

Hopefully, my code is in accordance to the quality acceptable by our tutors and professors. An sample would be as follows:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Duke("data/duke.txt").run();
}
```

## Errors

One thing you might notice about my code is that I chose to create my errors as DukeErrors as seen below:

    public enum DukeError
    
This is mainly because I did not want to interupt the flow of the conversation by throwing an exception. However, I will be considering extending the Exceptions class in the future if necessary.
